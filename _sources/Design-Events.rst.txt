About Events
=============
Events are the core of the timeline, as they represent the main (and initial) source of information about each piece of history.

Each event consists of three parts

* The body, which consists of a blurb about each event (I.E Apple launches the Macintosh).
* The date of the event (I.E January 24, 1984)
* The location of the event (I.E Cupertino, U.S)

Each event when clicked on will link to a EventInFocus

Design
----------
Each event should have:

 * a gradient

 * a marker

 * a line separator

 * the body of the text itself

  * Date
  * Location
  * Blurb

 * A picture

Each event, visually, ideally, be unique in some way:

* fonts
* gradient
* eclipse

etc, can be uniquely rendered!
